# nlpcapstone
This repository serves as a hub for my NLP Capstone project. My final project can be found at
https://github.com/haldenl/attention-visualizer


Below are the child repositories I am developing in.

- TensorBoard Attention Plugin: https://github.com/haldenl/tb-attention-plugin
- Fork of Pointer-Generator model, created by [See et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04368.pdf): https://github.com/haldenl/pointer-generator

Currently this repository houses the following:

- A set of visualization prototypes, found under `visualization_prototypes/`. To view these,
  run a simple HTTP server (e.g. `python -m http.server`) from the root of the repository and
  navigate to the desired prototype.
